# Who am I?
Hey there! I'm Steve0Greatness, sometimes known as S0G. I'm a, mostly, self taught programmer with an interest in web development. I mostly work with JavaScript, and not much else. However, I also have some experience in Python, and I've written [at least 1 program in a ton of languages](https://fizzbuzz.stevesgreatness.repl.co/).
