# Welcome
Hi, I'm Steve0Greatness; you can call me S0G. I'm a mostly self tought programmer with an interest in JavaScript, and (to a lesser extent) Python. I also know how to use Scratch, but let's be honest, everyone does. 

## A bit more about myself
* I perfer hexcode colors over RGB(A).
* I'm scared of languages other than JS and Python because their syntax is confusing.
* My pronouns are He/Him.
* I have too many cats.
* I like Undertale and Deltarune.
